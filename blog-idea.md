a blogpost the explains why genai should be a copilot and developers should not "fall asleep at the wheel".

- devs can have more fun by using ai -> I particularly enjoy voice input
- AI is best when you know the thing it is doing. When AI writes some audio recording and playback code for you, it's all good and dandy but that topic happens to be frickle and you will need to learn to fix the AIs mistakes. But when the AI does some visuals or common text input stuff (that you are familiar with), it will be easy to guide it right.
- AI does not make writing code faster but we can focus on other things than details: the high level. this leads to easier to maintain code and thus saves time in the long run
- AI code is often less structured and more cluttered but most often we care about value more than code quality, a hard pill to swallow
- I am excited about having more fun coding through the use of AI, after all - I am a developer for the fun of it.
